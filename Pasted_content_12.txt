📋 Handy2Know – Full Prompt for Manus

Hi Manus,

I’m on your Pro Plan and I need you to take full ownership of getting Handy2Know to a working, monetisable MVP.

Core values
– Fairness and transparency for both trades and customers.
– Premium black & gold look and feel, mobile-friendly UX.
– No fake or placeholder data on the live site (use a separate test environment if needed).
– Reliable, easy-to-use platform that helps trades win work and gives back to the community.

Immediate Critical Issues (from your testing report):
– Forms not saving data or sending emails.
– Admin panel inaccessible (no password, no link).
– Navigation/hamburger broken on mobile.
– Branding inconsistent / placeholder text still visible.
– No confirmation message after form submissions.
– Reviews & collaboration features not live.
– .co.uk domain not redirecting to .com.
– Slow performance / unoptimised images.

Please fix these issues as top priority.

Feature Roadmap & Deliverables

Phase 1 – MVP (must-have for launch)

– Customer Job Request form → Google Sheets + email notification to handy2knowteam@gmail.com.
– Trade Signup form → Google Sheets + email notification.
– Password-protected Admin dashboard (view/search/export) accessible on iPhone.
– Working menus & branding (black & gold, mobile-friendly).
– No placeholder text; thank-you confirmation after form submission.
– handy2know.co.uk redirects to handy2know.com.
– Optimise images/code for mobile performance.

Phase 2 – Early Differentiators

– Two-way review system: both customers and trades can rate/review each other after a job. Capture star rating + comment, display snippet on profiles, moderation queue in Admin.
– Trade collaborations: allow trades to team up on jobs, share reviews, and showcase joint work.
– “Collaboration of the Month” & “Tradesperson of the Month” spotlights on homepage and profiles.
– Profit-share dashboard showing funds to local projects (once profits exceed £100k, 50% to community).

Phase 3 – Community & Media

– Live Video Streaming to YouTube: trades can paste their YouTube live stream link into their profile; build an “HTK Live” page showing current/upcoming live streams via YouTube API; show last 3 videos on each trade’s profile.
– Competitions & Projects: monthly competitions for trades/customers (best before-after project, most eco-friendly build); users upload photos/videos; winners featured on homepage/social media; community project voting for profit share funding.
– Sponsorship integration: space on homepage/dashboards for sponsor logos (“Sponsored by…”); ability to feature sponsored competitions/prizes or “tools of the month”; optional links to sponsor offers for trades.
– Product Showcasing: section for trades to showcase products, tools, or materials they use (photos, descriptions, links); option for sponsors to feature products here (“Featured Product of the Month”); integration with live video for demos.
– Leaderboards, badges, eco badges.
– Trade forums/groups, marketplace for spare materials.
– Refer-a-friend rewards.

Phase 4 – Advanced Features

– Instant quotes for customers.
– In-app chat & file sharing between trades and customers.
– Scheduling / booking calendar integration.
– Milestone payments / escrow.
– Training modules for trades.

Payments/Donations

– Stripe Payment Links for donations/memberships.
– Membership tiers (Bronze free, Silver/Gold/Platinum paid).
– Credit system for purchasing leads.
– Sponsor slot spaces on homepage and dashboard.
– Profit-share counter showing donations to community.

Standing Instructions
– Preserve all existing features and styling; never remove anything currently built unless replacing with improved version.
– No fake or placeholder data on the live site; use separate test environment if needed.
– Maintain this roadmap and update it as I send new ideas.
– Provide a checklist of Done / In Progress / Missing for each item, plus timeline for remaining tasks.
– Handle the deploy and domain linking directly — everything you need is already in the GitHub/Netlify accounts you have access to.
– Once deployed, send me the live URL and admin login details.

My goal is to have a working Handy2Know MVP where a customer or trade can submit a form from their phone, I receive an email, and it immediately appears in my admin dashboard/Google Sheets. Then progressively add the differentiator features above.

Please begin by:
	1.	Fixing the immediate critical issues.
	2.	Deploying to handy2know.com with handy2know.co.uk redirecting.
	3.	Sending me the filled checklist and your timeline for the remaining phases.

Thank you.

That’s everything you’ve described — MVP, fixes, unique features, payments, core values — in one clear prompt.
You can copy and paste that to Manus as a single message.

Do you want me to also prepare a visual checklist table (with columns Done/In Progress/Missing) so Manus can tick off items when he reports back?
